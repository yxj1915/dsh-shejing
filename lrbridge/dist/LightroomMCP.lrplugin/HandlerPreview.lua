-- The Lightroom SDK can render a JPEG of any catalog photo through
-- photo:requestJpegThumbnail(width, height, callback). The callback runs
-- asynchronously on a background render task, so we poll a completion
-- flag with LrTasks.sleep() instead of blocking.
--
-- The JPEG bytes are written to a file next to the MCP token
-- (<home>/.config/lightroom-mcp/previews/) so the MCP server can read
-- them back and attach the image inline to the tool response (Claude
-- Desktop renders image content blocks in the conversation). Writing to
-- disk keeps the large binary out of the line-delimited JSON socket
-- protocol entirely.
--
-- Old previews are pruned to bound disk usage: the folder keeps the
-- newest MAX_FILES_KEPT files (filenames embed a unix timestamp, so a
-- lexicographic sort on the timestamp field approximates mtime order
-- without a stat() API, which LrFileUtils does not expose).
