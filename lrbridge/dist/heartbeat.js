// Heartbeat: ping the plugin on this interval so it can tell a healthy-but-
// idle session apart from a genuinely dead connection (issue #134 follow-up,
// PR #151 review) instead of relying on a long fixed idle timer. The plugin
// derives liveness from any inbound message -- ping included -- via its
// existing lastRequestTime tracking, so this side doesn't need to react to a
// missed pong itself; a failed/timed-out ping is only logged for visibility.

 * connection state -- a failed ping is just logged via onError, never thrown.
